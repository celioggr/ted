The present work was carried out in late 2015 under the Programming Lab class and developed by myself and [@carlosbernardes](https://github.com/carlosbernardes).
It consists of a simple text editor with a multi-buffer feature (it spawns a new writable buffer) and uses lanterna for GUI.

## Dependencies

* Java 8
* [lanterna-2.1.7.jar](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lanterna/)
* Junit (for unit testing)

## Running
